{I'd like to start with an old game by one of the deepest positional players ever, Rubinstein. This game is not exactly unknown, but I will propose a new perspective on this game that seems helpful.  It seems to me that the key to understanding what is going on in this game is to think about black as playing noncommittal, solid moves, and most importantly REACTING to mistakes by white.  This game emphasizes the negative side of pawn moves and in many cases Rubinstein's key moves come AFTER pawn moves by white have weakened his position in some way.  And before we get into the game I would also tentatively suggest that it makes a good "solitaire chess" exercise if you're up for it.  I haven't awarded points for each move or anything like that, but if you configure your program so you can't see the moves and make a quick run through with the arrow keys, comparing your guesses to Rubinstein before you look at my notes, I think it would make the game and notes that much more valuable.} 
1. e4 e5 2. f4 Bc5 3. Nf3 d6 4. Nc3 Nc6 5. Bb5 $5 
{The first four moves might be out of fashion, but this move is the first to seem slightly odd.  Clearly the bishop is best on c4; because white can, and eventually will probably exchange on e5, the bishop will support the rook on the open f-file bearing down on f7 (although it is a complication that white cannot castle to do this), and the bishop cannot be challenged by ...d5.  Instead of playing the most natural move, Alapin pursues a more concrete, but one-dimensional idea.} 
5... Bg4 6. d3 Nge7 $1 
{There are many ways to look at this move, which seems to be clearly best if less obvious than 6...Nf6.  I would like to see it as black's first "reaction" move, against the slightly odd 5.Bb5.  After black castles and eradicates the pin, this bishop essentially stops contributing to the fight for the center, since Bxc6 can be met with a recapture by the knight.} 
7. h3 Bxf3 8. Qxf3 O-O 9. f5 $6 
{In this game, it seems that every time white moves a pawn, it causes him trouble.  Here he returns the bishop pair (although it wasn't easy to see what to do with it) and takes the pressure off of the center, making it easier for black to play ...d5.} 
9... Nd4 10. Qg3 Nxb5 11. Nxb5 
(11. Bh6 Ng6 $1 12. fxg6 fxg6) 
11... f6 $1 12. Be3 Bxe3 13. Qxe3 d5 $1 14. O-O $6 
(14. Qf2 $142 c6 15. Nc3 $15) 
14... c6 $1 15. Na3 
{This is a very ugly knight.  Besides that, the crux of black's advantage is that he has the lever to open the d-file WHEN HE IS READY TO DO SO, by way of which he takes over the game.} 
15... Qb6 $5 16. Qxb6 axb6 17. c3 
{This creates a serious weakness on d3.  One implication is that now exd5, trying to liquidate into a slightly worse position, becomes impossible as black recaptures with a rook and puts too much pressure on the weak pawn.  Less obvious is that after black exchanges d-pawns, the square remains weak, and in fact white's entire queenside, especially the a4 and c4 squares.  This is because, with c2-c3 already played, b2-b3 creates further weaknesses.  Nonetheless, it was already difficult for white, and the idea to get his knight into play seemed reasonable.} 
(17. Nb1 dxe4 $5 (17... Rfd8 18. Nc3 dxe4 19. Nxe4) 18. dxe4 Rfd8 19. Nc3 Rd2 $1 (19... Rd4 20. Rad1) 20. Rf2 Rd4 {also seems very good for black.}) 
17... Rfd8 $1 
{Of course the a8-rook, since it is doing something where it is, should be the last to move.} 
18. Rf2 Rd7 $1
{And this is the key; black is able to take over the d-file because of his pawn lever.} 
19. Nc2 Rad8 20. Re1 dxe4 21. dxe4 Nc8 $1 
{And this can be seen as the second "reaction move".  Because 17.c3 created weaknesses on a4 and c4, black prepares to bring his knight within reach of those squares.} 
22. Rfe2 b5 23. Na1 Nb6 24. Nb3 Na4 $1 25. Kf2 c5 26. Rc2 g6 $3 
{Everything was going nicely on the queenside; black has a grip on the d-file and a very bothersome knight while white's pieces just look jumbled up, and suddenly Rubinstein makes a move on the side of the board we had forgotten all about.  It seemed he wasn't interested in playing out ...c4 Nc1 on the board yet since it gives white information before black is ready to strike.  Instead, it's time to calmly improve matters some more, waiting for white to make more concessions before black REACTS.  And ...g6 fxg6 does improve matters because now black can create a passer at any moment with ...f5.}

{Now 29.b3 is met by 29...Nc5.} 
29. Ke3 Kf7 30. Rf1 Rd1 $1 
{Rubinstein seems to remove all of white's good pieces, while maintaining just enough material to win.  Now white has no chances to double on f6.} 
31. Rxd1 Rxd1 32. Ke2 Rd8 
{Even now, the weaknesses of the queenside and the e4-square prevent white from challenging the d-file for several moves.} 
33. Ke3 Nc5 34. b3 Ke6 35. bxc4 bxc4 36. Rb2 $5 
{White goes for counterplay, but this also weakens his own defenses.} 
36... Rd1 37. Rb6+ Kd7 38. Ne2 
{The knight is clumsy on this square and no longer controls d3, so now white has to hope that his counterplay with the rook will come to something.}

{The following recent game by Nisipeanu, who made an amazing run in the World Championship in Vegas a couple of years ago, shows, at the same time, some good solid chess, and the ability to break out of normal patterns when it is advantageous to.} 
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 11. c3 Ne7 $5 
{I have to admit that I'm not well-versed in the theory of this variation with 9.Nd5 instead of 9.Bxf6, but I know enough that this move causes me to sit up and pay attention. The idea of the 9.Nd5 line, as I understand it, is that black cannot get away with challenging the knight this easily. Presumably the kingside weaknesses are too much if black is also without his dark-squared bishop. But black says: "show me".} 
12. Nxf6+ gxf6 13. Bd3 
{The bishop often stays put for a long time in these lines, so this isn't an obvious case of "finish development, get castled",... especially if you see how white continues! Regarding development of the bishop to d3 in general - it is meant to be prophylactic, I think, against ...d5 and ...f5, but white has to show some care in that the bishop can find itself misplaced if black gets an opportunity to play ...f5 as a sac and then start rolling the center.} 
(13. Nc2 {seemed more flexible, but white will still have to decide what to do at some point.})
13... Bb7 14. Qe2 
{Keeping his castling options open, but soon he will have to choose and he will certainly go kingside...} 
14... d5 15. O-O-O $5
{Well I'll be damned! Actually, looking over this game a second time around, this seems very logical. If you read my notes to last week's game, you might even agree that this is a "reaction" move agaist 14...d5, the possibility of which white has cleverly kept open, but, but... the Na3 is supposed to go to the center, white is supposed to play a4 to activate the a1-rook, etc. Patterns can be useful, but they can be limiting as well. Apparently Nisipeanu is less susceptible to being limited by patterns than I am.} 
15... Qc7 16. Nc2 O-O-O 17. exd5 
{Opening the center and preparing some exchanges. In general, white's advantage can be expected to grow as more pieces are exchanged, because his pawn structure is better. One possible modification to note, however, is that if white keeps the knights on the board, this may prove useful to tickle the weak a6 and c6 squares around black's king.} 
17... Kb8 18. Be4 f5 19. d6 Rxd6 20. Bxb7 Kxb7 21. Rxd6 Qxd6 22. Rd1 Qe6 23. Nb4 Rc8 
(23... Nc6 $5 24. Nxc6 Kxc6 {might come into consideration, reasoning along the same lines as we did above, that keeping knights on the board is in white's favor. White is clearly somewhat better here too, but it looks to me that his advantage can be kept within bounds. One complication is that most pure pawn endings are probably winning for white, but I don't see how white can force this.}) 
24. Qd3 e4 
{I don't like this move. Black almost forces white to penetrate into the position, which he was probably intending anyway. In black's defense, it takes some calculation to see how bad this actually is.} 
(24... Nc6 {would be my choice again, but it isn't a panacea.} 25. Qd7+ Rc7 26. Qxe6 (26. Qd5 $1 {is the machine's (Hiarcs) suggestion, and looks very hard to meet, for example:} 26... Qxd5 27. Nxd5 Rd7 28. Nf6 Rxd1+ 29. Kxd1 h6 30. Ng8 h5 31. Nh6) 26... fxe6 27. Nxc6 Kxc6 {and black is OK in this line.}) 
25. Qd7+ Rc7 26. Qxe6 fxe6 27. Rd6 a5 28. Na6 $1 
{The second move from white in this game to take me completely by surprise. The a6-square seems remote and unlikely, not least because the knight is nearly trapped there. For these reasons I would be tempted not to look at it at all. But after you see it, it becomes clear that 28. Na6 is the winning move, since in this case white's rook penetrates and becomes unanswerable after the slightly tricky knight exchange.} 
(28. Nc2 {also looks pretty good, however, due to the following line:} 28... Rc6 29. Rd7+ Rc7 30. Rxc7+ Kxc7 31. Nd4 {and white wins a pawn.}) 
28... Rc6 29. Rd7+ Kxa6 30. Rxe7 b4 
(30... h6 31. Rh7 e5 32. Re7 {proves that black must lose a pawn.})
31. Kc2 a4 32. Rxh7

{Nothing helped.} 
(39... Rh6 40. Rh3 Kc4 41. g4 $5 {It is regrettable to allow black some counterplay, so maybe white could do something more refined. Nonetheless, this does seem to win easily enough.} 41... fxg3 42. fxg3 Kd4 43. g4 e3 (43... Ra6 44. h6 Rxa2+ 45. Kb3 Ra8 46. h7 Rh8 47. g5 e3 48. Kc2 {wins.}) 44. g5 Ra6 45. h6 Rxa2+ 46.

{The following game is hard-fought, and, please bear in mind that I will get a lot of things wrong in a hard-fought game between GMs, especially since I haven't used anyone else's notes as a benchmark. Nonetheless, hopefully my impressions are interesting, if only for their mistakes... Regarding the game (from now on the caveat "as I see it" is implicit), the opening features an original rook maneuvre which leads to crushing pressure on the queenside. His opponent puts every obstacle in the way, offering a pawn to organize his pieces. White declines the pawn on the first pass and black gets a barely playable game, but after black misses his chance to break out, white goes into "technical mode" and achieves a pleasant win.} 
1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 $5 
{This could be just a move-order trick, or a signal that white is going to play one of the systems without c2-c4, for example the Torre (3.Bg5) or the Zukertort (3.e3, 4. Bd3, 5. b3,...). As a generality, if white is just going to play c4 later, I think this move loses more flexibility than it gains.  However, once you know your own and your opponent's repertoire this may not be the case. For example black cannot get a Benko proper now if white doesn't want to co-operate. This may have been what black had in mind, because he isn't happy to let white transpose to one of various standard openings, so the game goes down a relatively original path.} 
2... c5 
(2... d5 $5 3. c4 e6 {This is an important nuance to be aware of. By going into the QGD after white has played Nf3, black more or less avoids the Exchange variation, for example:} 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Nc3 c6 6. Bg5 Be7 7. e3 Bf5 $1 {and black has equalized.  Black is never able to get in ...Bf5 so painlessly in the QGD Exchange proper.}) 
3. d5 b5 $5 
{Bravo! This is the "I'm not going to let you get back into a normal opening" move.} 
(3... d6 4. c4 e6 5. Nc3 exd5 6. cxd5 g6 {was also possible, and would be another of the lines that aims to "punish" white for an early Nf3. At the moment, the most dangerous line against the Benoni involves an early f2-f4.}) 
4. Bg5 Ne4 5. Bf4 Bb7 6. a4 Qa5+ $2 
{A thematic looking idea which doesn't work, but Hebden's continuation was not so easy to foresee. It takes a lot of courage to explore these variations that are off the beaten track, and for that Degraeve gets my respect. I remember annotating some of my own games a couple years ago that reached distinctly messy positions, and it was incredible to me how many mistakes and outright blunders were made in such games. Even 450 points up the rating ladder, I suspect that it isn't easy.} 
(6... Nf6 $5 {looks bizarre but it is probably the right move. The "point" is that 7.Nc3 b4 is not possible for white.}) 
7. Nbd2 Bxd5 8. axb5 Qd8 9. Ra4 $1 
{This is the sting. Without this move, black is behind in development, but had good prospects with a grip on the center, and a better pawn structure. Now he is losing the fight in the center, coming under pressure on the queenside, falls further begind in development (e4 hitting the bishop), and is fighting to stay alive.} 
9... Nxd2 
(9... f5 {can only be justified if black keeps the knight in the center, so} 10. e3 e6 11. Bd3 Nxd2 12. Nxd2 {is good for white:} 12... Bxg2 $2 13. Rg1 Bb7 14. Qh5+)
10. Nxd2 d6 11. e4 Bb7 12. Qa1 
{There is no way to defend a7, so white has a big advantage after only 12 moves. Impressive, but now black digs in.} 
12... e5
(12... Qb6 {doesn't help after} 13. Nc4)

14. Bxe7 Kxe7 $1 
{Both sides splay some originality this game. In this case it all comes to a disappointment for black, but 14...Kxe7, increasing co-ordination along the back rank, is nonetheless a nice motif to remember. 14...Qxe7 15.Rxa7 was simply losing, but now he is ready to meet 15.Rxa7 with 15...Nd7 and 16...Nb6.  Of course white is still much better here and black doesn't have any active compensation for the pawn, but the extra pawn is on the queenside where black has a sturdy blockade, and he just might be able to hold.} 
15. Bd3 Nd7 16. O-O $2 
{An interesting moment, which brings up the point that it doesn't always pay to be super-sophisticated. Instead of taking the pawn, white prefers to triple pieces on the a-file and simply maintain the pressure. In some ways leaving black's pawn on the board doesn't make his position any easier to play, but I wonder nonetheless, did Hebden just assume he could triple pieces and pick up the a7-pawn at his leisure? It turns out this isn't the case.}

But I'm not sure that, given this position to look at, I would know anything beyond "white is better". What about you? Anyway, the rest of the game makes a lot of sense to me, which is not to diminish the fact that Hebden played it well, so the final commentary will be sparse.}

{After not playing too many tournaments in a while, I spent last week playing in the World Open U2200 Section in Philadelphia.  My result, 4.5/9, was disappointing given that last year I scored 6.5/9 in the same section, but the games were very interesting and will give me a lot to think about.  I will start analysing the fun games next week, but first I want to get the following debacle off my chest.  It is dedicated to all interesting players who have given in to playing "boring" openings, therefore sparing themselves from such a game.  After losing this game I definitely felt like I should be an 1.e4 c6 man.}

{What to say?  Nine moves of "book" so far, and we ain't even got started yet.  I don't know if anybody still bothers to think about these things conceptually, but it has always helped me to remind myself at this point why I am sacking a pawn.  Right, it clears the 'b' and 'c' files and the h8-a1, h7-b1 diagonals, all of which lead to white's king.  Sounds good...}

{14...Qb8 is also interesting.  14...Qb7 had been scoring badly at the top level recently, but that kind of cutting-edge theory rarely filters down to affect my games.  Basically I had played this for a long time, and I had never gotten burnt, so I didn't see any reason to fix it.  For all I know however, this is the losing blunder according to Deeper Blue.}

{I decided not to show any of my other games from the World Open because frankly, on closer inspection, they weren't as interesting as I had originally thought. Instead, I want to look at a very complicated win by John Nunn. The hardest part of annotating this game is to avoid just copying the excellent analysis that has already been written by Nunn himself, which I have access to in _Understanding Chess Move by Move_. Fortunately I saved some independent analysis done with Fritz after I had first seen the game and before I saw any notes, which contained several ideas that didn't exactly follow Nunn. It is doubtful I could have been as open-minded if I had seen his analysis first. In terms of possibly significant differences between the two analyses, I can point out 17...Bxf5 followed by 19...Qb4, where I went into greater detail but ultimately agreed with Nunn, and 22...Ne8, which I think is a possible improvement. By the way, my intention in presenting this game is not to topple Nunn's analysis, which I think would be quite hard. Instead it is an attempt to expand his work that considers some lines he might have just been strong enough to dismiss offhand, and most importantly it is just an excuse to introduce an awesome game to anyone who hasn't seen it already.}

{The following game can best be described as "mind-blowing", and it has been among my favorites for a long time. Therefore, one of the first games I intended to present as a "Game of the Week" was this one. The only thing that has held me back is that it proved incredibly hard to produce competent annotations. One of the problems is the same one I mentioned last week; that I can't just reproduce Shirov's notes from _Fire on Board_ so I have to diverge or improve on them. Of course diverging is easier! In most cases, my independent silicon-assisted notes (written as a first draft) emphasized slightly different points, and yet were accurate enough to keep, at least as a framework. However, at some critical moments only Shirov's notes approached what was really going on in the position. You will see how I dealt with the dilemma on black's twentieth move; hope you find it to be a reasonable solution.  Anyway, enjoy the game.}

{There are different reasons a game grabs one's eye.  It might be especially well-played.  Or, it might be especially instructive as regards an opening variation, for example; a so-called "model game".  This game is both.  By the way, the reader might get the impression that I am picking on Whitely's annotations to the game, which I have cited at several points, because I think they are poor.  This is not the case, rather the reason they got cited so much is because they were extremely relevant and a time saving starting point for me to attempt to dig deeper.}

{The following game was an important breakthrough for me. If you check your d   atabase, you will reach the conclusion that I played twenty moves of theory, and then my first independent move was a timid mistake that lost. However, "cross my heart and hope to die", I was playing on my own after move seven! When my opponent informed me after the game that it was all theory, I was shocked and somewhat annoyed, but, I won't lie to you, my overwhelming feeling was excitement. Wow, I had created all of these moves at the board! And this is why the game is a breakthrough, because now I know that, at least when all of the conditions are right, I can play chess at a high level. I think this confidence had something to do with my strong finish in the tournament.}

(14. Bg3 {is, it turns out, the approved main line. Suffice to say that I considered it at the board, but my calculations were completely inadequate to make a decision and I had to go with my gut. And I still was hoping that in a few moves it would become clear how to 'refute' my opponent's 'obscure' choice, so I went with the most aggressive choice.})
14... Qxb2 15. c4 !
{I finally resorted to this after rejecting the intended 15.O-O Qxe5 16.Nf6+ Nxf6 17.Bxf6 due to 17...Qxh2. The idea is simply to make black's knight move, but first I have to be willing to look at the position after 15...Qxg2. I decided, rightly it turns out, that there is nothing else and that the position at least remains unclear after 16.Rf1.}
15... Qxe5 16. cxd5 Bg7 !
{Very strong. If I move the rook then black has simply 17...cxd5. So eventually I realized that my next move, bizarre as it looks, is forced.}

(18... Bd4+ 19. Ke1 {This variation is very pleasing from the aesthetic/paradoxical point of view, given that white has just castled! From the chess viewpoint, there are no more checks and white's attack is very dangerous.})

{Everything is attacked!}

The main reason I hadn't looked at this move was that I thought my position would be okay after 22.Bxf4 in the game, and time trouble was already looming as well.

20... f4 21. Nf5 ?

1. d4
{This game fascinated me for two reasons.  For one thing, because black appears to proceed so smoothly towards a completely dominating position around move 30.  Usually this indicates a big understanding difference between the opponents, but Beliavsky is a strong GM. What happened?... and this brings us to the second reason.  There is one move by black in this game that does not quite fit the "smooth" mold; it is absolutely dynamite.  If you are using Chessbase Reader to look at this game or something similar, put it into training mode.  I will warn you before the move you should try to guess.}
1... Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 c5
{This move-order is used almost exclusively today to avoid the variations with f2-f4.  In Portisch's case it would have been a stylistic preference, but one which demonstrated admirable prescience.}
4. d5 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Nc3 g6 7. e4 Bg7 8. Be2 O-O 9. O-O Na6
{This is a very typical maneuver in the Benoni before a6, b5, although 9...a6 isn't a mistake.  The knight can be well-placed on c7 in conjunction with ...b5, even as a sack.  Also, unlike on d7, it doesn't get in the way from that square.}
10. Nd2
{Also a weird-looking move but you won't even glance twice if you've played through a lot of Benoni games. Playing the knight to c4 puts pressure on d6 and frees the path for the f-pawn.}
10... Re8 11. f3 Nc7 12. a4 b6
{This might seem inconsistent with what I said earlier about ...b5, but black isn't changing his plans. Rather, he is just going to play ...Ba6 and exchange it off for something first.}
13. Nc4 Ba6 14. Bg5 Qd7 15. Rb1 Bxc4 16. Bxc4 a6 17. b4 b5
{By the way, all of this, so far as I know, is still playable theory, and it may continue to be so for a few moves although I'm not certain.  Usually today it arises from the move-order 9...Re8.}
18. Bd3 c4 19. Bc2
{NOW!  Think about the position and try to guess what Portisch played.}
19... bxa4 $3
{So far I have emphasized that black's play is thematic and typical.  This move, on the other hand, is shocking and brilliant.  I am not a strong enough player to guaranantee to you the move's objective value, but I can tell you this.  Creativity, and keeping your opponent off balance, wins games.  Outplaying a strong opponent like Beliavsky as completely as we shall see later is not possible if he can predict all of your moves.  So, from a pragmatic point of view, completely sound or not, look for something like this in all of your games, as it can be absolutely devastating.}
20. Bxa4 Nb5
{This is the point.  By corrupting his pawn structure black brings the knight (which was doing nothing on c7) into the game.}
21. Kh1 Qb7 22. Bxb5 $2
{This completely vindicates black's plan.  Now he has a good structure back and he has made significant progress.  The a-file is open and the formerly useless c7-knight has been exchanged.}
(22. Bd2 {seemed better with unclear play.})
22... axb5 23. Be3 Ng4 $1
{Black wants to exchange pieces, which breaks down white's blockade and brings him closer to a position where the passed c-pawn is a real trump.}
24. Bd4 Ne3 25. Bxe3 Bxc3 26. Bd4 Bxd4 27. Qxd4 Qa7 28. Qc3 Qe7 29. Ra1
{White must co-operate.  Otherwise black continues with, for example, ...Ra6, Qa7, Rea8, etc.}
29... Rxa1 30. Qxa1 Rc8 31. Rc1 Qc7 32. Qc3
(32. Rc3 Qb6 {with the idea of ...Qd4 or ...Qf2.  Inevitably black penetrates the position:} 33. Rc2 Qe3)
32... Ra8 33. f4 Qa7 34. Qd2 Qa2 35. Qe1 Qb2 36. Rb1 c3 $3
{The final touch!  Black's c-pawn has already become devastating, and the queen can remain on offer for a few moves.}
37. h3 Ra2 38. Qf1 c2 39. Rc1 Qxb4 40. e5 Rb2 41. Qf2 Qe4 42. Kh2 Qxd5
{And white resigned not a moment too early.  As a sort of post-script, I want to add that this game is an interesting lesson about the way opening theory is developed.  After I had completed my notes, I got a copy of Ftacnik's notes for the Informator.  He basically had two interesting things to say.  One was regarding the move 21.Kh1, which he thinks is a mistake.  I have to admit that I don't really understand his analysis, as he seems to be assuming that in any case white must play Ba4xb5, which I didn't agree with.  The second thing that was really interesting was the suggestion of 19.Be2... What do you think is the idea of that move?  That's right, to prevent 19...bxa4!  After the brilliant 19...bxa4 has been discovered, somebody finds 19.Be2, invents a logical explanation which is condensed to one sentence (if you're lucky) in the opening monographs to save space, and theory moves on.  No wonder it is so hard to understand!  The lesson is to look for the games behind the moves, and be reluctant to just accept that one-sentence explanation and be denied the pleasure of discovering what is really, actually going on with 19.Bc2.}

{The following game has been nicely annotated in various sources as a model attacking game with the IQP.  It is instructive in that regard, and I will point out a few of the typical maneuvers.  However, my main interest is in the position before black's 28th move.  According to all of the sources, white has played in perfect model fashion and a couple of black's moves are mistakes... so I am very curious as to why I can't find a win for white after 28...h4. (!)

Well, white has played all of the right moves and, further, black has two pieces marooned on the queenside while his king is exposed.  Therefore, at first I naturally assumed that white had something.  But I can't find it!  The computers are very powerful advocates for concrete variations over generalities, and they tenaciously find resources for the material grabber.  Chess thought is already being re-evaluated in many variations (like the Poisoned Pawn, where white can no longer just "say" he has compensation), and this may be one more example.}

However, one of my weak points is that I have never really settled on a single main defense against 1.d4, and therefore I was already on somewhat unfamiliar ground.  The last time I had faced this move was almost a year ago against Ilye Figler, when I got crushed.  However, even after that game I had not prepared fully.}
5... cxd4 6. exd4 d5
{Bengston mentioned after the game that this line is out of fashion, but it was the only one I (sort of) knew.}
7. c5
{An ambitious move - also, not to be misleading, the normal move in this position.  Anyway the idea is that if black wants to keep the bishop then white will gain valuable tempi for queenside expansion.  In the game against Figler I had basically ignored white's idea with 7...O-O; this time I knew basically one more move... by the way, this is not the recommended way to learn theory, one move at a time!}
7... Ne4 8. Bd2 Bxc3
({It turns out that} 8... Nxd2 {is more highly recommended.  The following is a sample line:} 9. Qxd2 a5 $1 {An important strategic idea that never crossed my mind at the time.} 10. a3 Bxc3 11. Nxc3 a4 12. Bd3 b6 {and black appears to be making a fair fight of it on the queenside.})
9. Nxc3 Nxd2 $6
{This basically just hands white a pleasant position.  After I became disillusioned with 9...Nxc3 I didn't see anything else, but the situation actually should not be considered so desperate.}
(9... Nxc3 10. Bxc3 $1 {Leads to an interesting position.  My impression during the game was that white is just better here, not so much directly due to the bishop pair as due to his queenside wedge.  The c3-bishop looms large, however, if black tries to chip away the wedge by ...b6, or pulverize it by ...e5.  After the game UMBC's chess coach, Igor Epshtein disagreed, opining that ...e5 is not crucial and black can play around the wedge, and since the bishop is not doing that much then black is happy enough to have a knight... okay, verdict?  I dunno.} (10. bxc3 b6 $5 {This is what I was originally thinking about when I played 8...Bxc3, although it is also possible to play 10...O-O first.}))
(9... O-O {Is another approach, which seems to have theory's stamp of approval.  Black says he likes the e4-knight and doesn't want to exhange it for nothing.  Since 10.Bd3 could be met simply by 10...f5, the critical question is who benefits from changing the pawn structure.} 10. Nxe4 dxe4 11. Bf4 (11. Bc3 Qg5 {is interesting.}) 11... Nc6 12. Bd6 Re8 13. Qd2 e5 14. dxe5 Nxe5 {and black appears to be fine.})
10. Qxd2 O-O 11. Be2 b6
{This appears to be almost the only way for black to play.  The idea is to play 12...bc and to gain the c6-square if white re-captures with the b-pawn.  If white takes with the d-pawn, as in the game, then black gets a central majority.}
12. b4 bxc5
(12... a5 13. b5 {is terrible.})
13. dxc5
{The ambitious decision, which was easy to predict.  My opponent outrated me by about 200 points and so far he has every indication that things will go his way.  After all, I have taken a long time to play moves which are inferior to established theory.  Nonetheless 13.bc was worth a thought.} (13. bxc5 Bd7 {This was my intention during the game.  The following line is not forced, but it proves that white's idea has teeth.} 14. O-O Bc6 15. Rab1 Nd7 16. Rb3 Qc7 {Otherwise 17.Bb5 will be awkward.} 17. Nb5 $1 Bxb5 18. Bxb5 {And white is clearly better.})
13... Nc6 $1
{This was the crux of my idea, and it seems to be the best try.  The knight goes to e7 so it can support the center.}
14. b5
{Of course nothing could be more natural, and I was counting on this.  Nonetheless, 14.Rb1 should be considered for reasons that I will explain in a moment.}
14... Ne7
{The obvious idea is ...e5, but there is another threat that white has so generously helped me to create with his last move...}
15. O-O
(15. Bf3 a6 $1 {This is the point.  White's pawns are suddenly crippled in this line.  Therefore he is not able to stop ...e5.})
15... e5 16. f4
{After the game white explained that he had been relying on this move, which attempts to break apart my center.  Now enormous complications erupt.}
16... Qc7 $1 17. c6 d4 $1 18. Ne4 Qb6 $1
{I apologize for giving myself three exclams in a row... the idea isn't quite that brilliant, and I am not even certain if it is sound.  However, each move is an integral part of black's plan.  If I didn't have 18...Qb6 I wouldn't be able to gain the necessary tempo to protect d4 so I can push in the center, and the center would collapse.}
19. Kh1
(19. Nf2 e4 $1 {is a pretty side variation.})
(19. Bd3 $1 {is more critical:} 19... f5 $5 20. fxe5 fxe4 21. Bc4+ Be6 22. Bxe6+ Kh8 {and the central pawns look very imposing, but a pawn is a pawn and white's position is very active.  I suspect that if you analysed deeply enough it might transpire that white is just winning here.})
19... Bf5 20. Nd6
(20. Ng3 {is more stable but probably better for black after 20...e4.  White has a more challenging idea.})
20... e4 21. g4 $1
{This move definitely keeps the position from growing stale!  Seriously, the next few moves are highly critical - will black's center collapse or will he be able to make something of it?}
21... e3
{Apparently forced.}
22. Qb4 $6
{This is the most active square for the queen.  It is true that it allows 22...Nxc6, but then the queen can retreat and everything hangs.  It appears that ultimately this doesn't work, but I admit that I have not had time to analyse this position completely, as it is clearly rich with possibilities.}
(22. Qc1 Be6 {is very hard to assess, but probably gets preference since the game should be good for black.})
22... Nxc6 $1
({The calm treatment with} 22... Be6 23. Nc4 Qc7 {is also possible, and it is also hard to evaluate.  After my choice in the game the position becomes incredibly sharp but then reaches a fast resolution, which was easier on my nerves.  So after a quick check that I hadn't missed anything obvious, I crossed my fingers and played it.  It turns out that it is also best!})
23. Qa3 d3
{Forced.}
24. Bf3 Nd4 $6
{There are three main ideas behind my sack.  First, the pawns are going to try to net at least a rook.  Second, ...Nc2xa1 can pick up a stray exchange with tempo.  Finally, as Tal said once, white can only take one piece at a time.  However, these reasons are just some attempt to make conceptual sense of a random looking position.  If you really want to know what's going on, then the variations must speak for themselves, and it turns out that there was a better move.}
(24... Bxg4 $1 {is even stronger.  Black simply gives up a single piece, and leaves white to deal with the multiple threats including ...Nc2, a loose knight, and of course the passers.} 25. Bxg4 Nd4 26. Qxd3 {There is nothing better.} (26. Nc4 Qb7+ 27. Kg1 Qe4 $1 {and black has too many threats.}) 26... Qxd6 {With advantage to black.})
25. Nxf5
(25. Bxa8 Nc2)
25... e2 26. Bxa8

30. Qe2 h6
{An important move in any case, so this seems a good moment to get it in.}
31. a4
{Possibly the next two moves are too time-consuming... in any case white soon gets into trouble.  31.Rg1 might be better although, frankly, I prefer black here.}
31... Qd4 32. a5 Qd5+ 33. Qg2
{A sorry move, although my opponent explained that he had simply missed 34...Qd5.  However it isn't clear that he had better.}
(33. Kg1 Qxf5 34. Qe3 Rd6 $1 35. Qxa7 (35. b6 {is better, but then white loses his pawns and the king remains exposed.} 35... Rg6+ 36. Kh1 (36. Kf2 Qc2+) 36... axb6 37. axb6 Qb5) 35... Qg6+ 36. Kf2 Rd2+ 37. Ke1 Ra2 38. f5 Qf6 {and mates.})
33... Qxb5 34. Rg1 Qd5
{This is what Bengston had missed.  Now I had an excellent chance to win the game.}
35. f6 Qxg2+ $6
{After 35...g6 I probably could have won the endgame.}
(35... g6 36. Qxd5 {Otherwise white can do nothing, but this helps black by bringing the rook into play.} 36... Rxd5 37. Rc1 Rd6 $1 38. Rc8+ Kh7 39. Rc7 Rxf6 40.

Ra8 Ra4 43. Ra7 g5 44. Ra6 f6 {etc.})
36. Kxg2 gxf6 $2
{Again 36... g6 was correct.  This move is somewhat inexplicable in that now 36... g6 seems more or less obvious to me.  However, during the game I became distracted analysing what happens after 36... g6 if I go for the a-pawn instead of the f-pawn, when things are less clear.  I guess I didn't appreciate the full range of possibilities.  Now the position can even become dangerous to black because white's king is more active.  The finish is played at a low level and it's a shame for such a full-blooded middle game to end as this does.}
37. Kf3 Kf8 38. Ke4 Ke7 $2
(38... Rd2 {was much simpler.})
39. Rb1 f5+ $2
{This line is at best barely drawing.  My only excuse is that I couldn't belive I was in any trouble after the nice play earlier, i.e., I thought I should be fine through inertia.}
40. Ke5 f6+ 41. Kxf5 Rd5+ 42. Kg6 Rxa5 43. Re1 Kf8 44. Kxf6 $2
{I was just starting to appreciate how precarious my position was when this move appeared on the board.  Instead, after 44. f5 white could have made me sweat.  Although I don't see a win, neither do I see a clear way for black to a draw.}
(44. f5 Ra2 45. h4 Rg2+ 46. Kxf6 Rg4 47. Rb1 {is a starting point for analysis.  Again I have to admit that I'm not ready to give an opinion.  Hopefully you can forgive me and the game provides enough food for thought as it is.})
44... Ra6+
{And white accepted the draw.  All in all, neither of us probably deserved less... or more.}

This game, like most losses, was very painful at the time, but more than two years later I have no problem showing it.  However, it was much closer to the time of the game when I discovered the game I will show next week.

{In case you hadn't remembered, the "point" of this game is to compare it with last week's loss.  I think it is an ideal illustration of the type of model game you want to look for to provide an appropriate foil to your own mishandling of typical positions.  Again, here is the idea - you take your own loss, and go back and look at games that reached similar positions which were played at GM level.  This game, in comparison to the game last week, will hopefully demonstrate  what I am talking about better than words can.}

{A very typical and well regarded idea in the Najdorf.  The position is not the same, but the basic outline in both cases is - we are dealing with a fight for the e5-square.  What is interesting in this case is that white is successful and in a convincing way.  Admittedly there is a concrete mistake around move 20 by black before he can be overcome, but you have to realize that HE LOST PLAYING COMPLETELY PLAUSIBLE MOVES.  I.e., the only mistake he made was only a mistake because of the sophisticated way white punished it in this game.  You can't ask for more than that!}

1. d4
{I have just recently started using this almost exclusively, so that I can get a feel for it and ultimately broaden my repertoire. This was the strongest opponent I had since the switch (about 2350).}
1... Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3
{Before the game I had made friendly conversation with my opponent and he mentioned a win in the Gruenfeld, so there was a psychological twist. Should I play 3.Nc3?  And when I did, he would have to consider that I must not be afraid of the Gruenfeld,...}
3... Bg7 $5
{I have no idea if he plays both lines regularly or if these considerations actually came into play, since I had to leave immediately after the game.}
4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 9. b4
{This is the first time I have had the white side of this position.}
9... a5 10. bxa5 Rxa5 11. a4 Nd7
(11... c5 {is considered standard as far as I know. Now I was on my own.})
12. Ba3
(12. Nd2 {also seems highly logical. I wanted to keep open the possibility of meeting ...f5 with Ng5, but there is also another consideration.})
12... Bh6
{This seems like a good plan. First of all it prepares ...f5. The other point is that on Nd2 he can take it now. I realized this, but I was lured to play it anyway because I saw a pretty tactic that would be nice to get on the board!}
13. Nd2 $5
(13. Bc1 Bg7 14. Nd2 {seems like the more "orthodox" choice. Not in the classical sense of course - white is retreating a piece to avoid trading a bishop for knight. But from some kind of schematic point of view it is more expected to keep the knight.})
13... Bxd2 14. Qxd2 f5 15. Nb5 $1
{This is the idea that enticed me to play 13.Nd2. There is a pretty tactic that allows me to take the initiative on the queenside.}
15... Ra8
(15... Rxa4 16. Bxd6 $1 Rxa1 17. Bxc7 Rxf1+ 18. Bxf1 Qe8 19. Nd6 {is the point.})
16. f4 $2
{Very interesting, but I passed up a big chance here. In fact I wanted to play 16.c5 very much as it seems like the thematic move, but I missed the critical follow-up 19.Qb2.}
(16. c5 Nxc5 (16... dxc5 17. d6 cxd6 18. Qxd6 {gives white huge activity and did not trouble me during the game, nonetheless it is probably best:} Rxa4 19. Bxc5 $5 Rxa1 20. Rxa1 Nxc5 21. Bc4+ Kg7 22. Qxe5+ Rf6 23. Qxc5 fxe4) 17. Bxc5 dxc5 18. Bc4 Kg7 {Black gets out of the discovery but sets himself up for other problems.} 19. Qb2)
16... b6 $1
{Very calm. Black is apparently under a lot of pressure but he still wants to let me release the central tension. I think I justified his choice in the game.}
(16... exf4 17. Bb2 {Defends a4 and switches to a nice diagonal so black will regret ...Bxd2.  It is unlikely white will experience any nervousness about being a pawn down until black can mend his position.})
17. fxe5
(17. Bb2 {seems better now. Instead I acted typically of the weaker player in a high pressure game and tried to simplify things, making concessions.})
17... Nxe5 18. Bb2 Bd7
{This is the big difference - it turns out that now black has more breathing space. Nonetheless I could have played better and maintained a completely healthy position.}
19. Bxe5
{Not forced but not bad if I follow it up right.}
dxe5 20. Qg5
(20. Qb2 $5 {This was the main alternative I considered during the game. The main idea is to re-capture on b5 with the queen, avoiding the ugly static endgame that arises in the game because of my suddenly weak dark squares and a case of bad B vs good N.} Bxb5 21. Qxb5 fxe4 22. Rxf8+ Kxf8 {I was afraid I might not have enough comp for the pawn here, but for one thing I can regain the sacked material immediately.} 23. Qb1 $5)
(20. c5 $1 {is sharp and completely logical (suggested by Judah Brownstein). I considered it at various points, but not here as far as I recall, for reasons I don't understand now.} Bxb5 21. axb5 Rxa1 22. Rxa1 bxc5 23. Qc3 fxe4 (23... Qd6 24. Ra6) 24. Bc4 Nxd5 $2 25. Rd1)
20... Bxb5 21. axb5 Rxa1 22. Rxa1 Nc8
(22... Qd6 23. Qe3 fxe4 {is more ambitious and also worth consideration. This worried me during the game slightly more than the line played.}) 
23. Qxd8 Rxd8
{Because of my feeble play I am worse now.  However, it isn't clear to me whether black is actually ever winning.}
24. Ra8 Rf8
{This is correct, but not for the reasons I thought at the time. In fact 24...Kf8 is best met the same way as in the game whereas I had intended 25.c5.}
(24... Kf8 25. c5 (25. exf5 $1 {is best, and improves on the game for white:} gxf5 26. g4) 25... Ke7 (25... bxc5 26. d6 cxd6 27. b6) 26. cxb6 cxb6 {and white has to tread carefully.})
25. exf5 gxf5 26. g4 f4
(26... Nd6 {looked more disconcerting at the time but was not necessarily better:} 27. Ra7 (27. Rxf8+ Kxf8 28. gxf5 Ke7 29. Kf2 Kf6 {is clearly better for black but I don't know if its a win or the sunny side of a draw.}) 27... Rf7 (27... f4 $2 {This worried me most at the time but it isn't sound as the pawns aren't nearly fast enough to create threats before white's rook comes a knocking:} 28. Rxc7 e4 29. Rc6 f3 30. Bf1 (30. Bxf3 {also defuses the idea.}) 30... e3 31. Rxd6 e2 32. Kf2 Re8 33. Re6 {and white is winning easily.}) 28. gxf5)
27. Bd3 Nd6
{A "sack". However it is more or less the only winning try and hardly puts black in danger of losing.}
(27... h6 {gives white time to set up a blockade:} 28. Kf2 Nd6 29. Rxf8+ Kxf8 30. Kf3 {I'm pretty certain this is a draw. White plays h4 and shuffles his bishop on the f1, d3 squares. Black cannot find a way to guard f4 so he can never push through ...e4.})
28. Bxh7+ Kg7 29. Rxf8 Kxf8 30. Bd3 e4 31. Bc2 Kg7 32. h4 Kf6 33. Kf2 Kg6
{Black was down to his last ten minutes and decides to repeat. Frankly I think the position was drawn anyway.}
(33... Ke5 {is the winning try. Black can't allow both of my pawns free rein but he needs to let them advance a bit to get at them. Actually even if he wanted to play this 33...Kg6 first makes sense because it allows me to err with 34.Bxe4.} 34. h5 Kf6 35. h6 Kg6 36. g5 Kh7 37. Ke2 Kg6 38. Kf2 {and I think there is nothing more for black to try.})

{This week you will notice a new section on my site which contains an attempt to mix humour and chess.  Definitely check it out and see if I was successful!  One of the highlights is this game, which is annotated there by Dave Brogan.  Here I will offer my opinions.}
1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5
{He mentions at this point that the French is the refutation to 1.e4,... and you might be wondering where the hell that statement could be coming from.  Well I would just like to point out that, in serious tournament games, he has played 1.e3 e5 2.d3 d5 3.d4 many times.}
3. Nd2 Nf6
(3... c5 4. dxc5 {This is an attempt by white to force the IQP structure, but it is too direct and shouldn't worry black for a few reasons.} 4... Bxc5 (4... Nf6 5. exd5 Qxd5 {is the simplest way to equalize in my opinion.}) 5. Nb3 Bb6 6. exd5 exd5 {And here I think black is more or less happy anyway.  True, white has forced the IQP (which wouldn't have been possible after 4.ed5 Qd5!?), but this is a good version compared to the lines where black has to play ...Be7xc5 as two moves.})
4. e5 Nfd7 5. Bd3 c5 6. c3 Nc6 7. Ne2 cxd4 8. cxd4 Nb6 $5
{8...f6 is the normal main line and is in my opinion better because it challenges the center.  However, black's idea in the game should not be completely underestimated.  When one side has lots of space to maneuver it is typically thought that he has an "easier position to play" which is not true.  What is true is that he has an objective advantage because he can decide when to strike.  However, he has to make the decision over the board and this can be a very hard call to make.  If he strikes at the wrong moment he will free his opponent's pieces and hand over the advantage along with a complete psychological reversal.}
9. O-O Be7 10. f4 g6 11. a3
{11.Nf3 looks better as it isn't clear yet that ...Nb4 will be a problem.}
11... a5 12. b3 $1
{I agree that this is a good move for more or less the same reasons as Brogan states in his notes.}
12... Bd7 13. g4 $5
{This looks OK to me.  True, white will have to be patient before a direct assault with f4-f5 is going to work.  However, this stakes out some space and prevents ...h5, so I don't see a problem.}
13... Qc7 14. Bb2 f5 $1
{Black finds a strong defensive resource. This immediately neutralizes whites kingside play. This is what puts question to whites early g4.}
(14... O-O $6 {I think ultimately this is just wrong.  However it will be extremely hard to prove it against a tactically accurate defense.  See my comment to move 8.}) (14... h5 15. g5 Rc8 $6 (15... O-O-O {looks like a better plan when I'm not certain that white has anything.}) 16. Rc1 O-O 17. Rc3 {Now this looks very shaky as a sack on h5 is hanging over black's head and can drop at any moment.})
15. gxf5 $5
(15. exf6 {is the more classical option followed by Nf3 when white has a grip on the center because of the backward pawn.})
15... exf5 $2
{This is a huge decision, and I think that 15...gf5 would have been more natural.}
(15... gxf5 16. Kh1 O-O-O 17. Nc3 Rdg8 18. Nb5 Qd8 19. Rc1 {In my opinion this position is roughly equal.})
16. Nf3 a4 17. b4 O-O 18. Rc1 Qd8 19. Bc3 $2
{A natural move but the wrong one.  This is actually an extremely interesting position that Dave and I analysed at some length.  I think the correct plan is Kf2!! (which he mentions), followed by Ke3, h4-h5 etc.  The move he played in the game is completely natural but it simply doesn't work.  This was hard enough to see in hindsight, and I envy the player that could see it at the board!}
19... Na7 20. Be1 Bb5 $2
(20... Nb5 {is correct, after which black starts to take over the game.  The main idea is simply to threaten the a3-pawn, but it proves extremely unpleasant for white to defend it.} 21. Bxb5 (21. Ra1 Rc8) 21... Bxb5)
21. Nc3 Bxd3 22. Qxd3 Qd7 23. Bh4 Bxh4 24. Nxh4 Rac8 25. Ng2 Nc4 26. Nb1 $5
{26.Ne3! is better.  However the position is quiet enough that, surprisingly, black proves unable to use the extra two moves for anything useful.  Check out the move 29...Re6 if you don't believe me.}
26... Rc6 27. Ne3 Rfc8 28. Nc3
{A good move even if it does involve admitting 26.Nb1 was a waste of time.}
28... Nxe3 29. Qxe3 Re6
{This is depressing for black because it admits that there was nothing constructive to do with the two extra tempi.}
(29... b5 $5)
30. Qf3 Rd8 31. Rc2 Kg7 32. Rfc1 Rc6 33. Qd3 Rdc8 34. b5
{I'm not so enthusiastic about this move.  In my opinion the position is roughly even now (the last great chance for white was 19.Kf2), and this is asking for trouble.  Of course such a move may be justified, for instance in time trouble when you need to produce a decisive result.  Even if it doesn't work and you become slightly worse, it may actually improve your winning chances by giving your opponent an obligation to avoid the draw!  Nonetheless, from the chess point of view white should avoid weakening himself.}

37. Qxd4 $5
(37. Qb3 {also isn't stupid and deserved attention although it may not be as flashy as 37.Qxd4.  Furthermore it is somewhat incredible that 37.Qxd4 doesn't lose for white, a point that hinges on some tactical features that almost seem to be "accidental".})

42... Ne6 43. Nd1
(43. Rd6 $5 {This was extremely hard for me to understand, although the computers all seem to go for it.  Why not 43.Re7?  The reason is that it gets in the way of the e-pawn.  Anyway see Dave's analysis for details.})

{_This is the second game of the week with "guest annotations" by Andy Samuelson.  As before, my notes are in underscores. (TH)_  This game was played in the last round of the Northern Virginia Open. I had 3.5/5 and was half a point ahead of the next highest B player in the tournament for the Class B prize. I had also played 3 FIDE rated players and needed to play a fourth to get a FIDE rateable performance. Luckily, I got paired against a FIDE expert in the last round.}
1. e4 g6 2. d4 Bg7
{I've never felt comfortable playing against the Modern Defense, so I was not happy to see this in an important last round game!}
3. Nc3 d6 4. Be3 a6
{I was unfamiliar with this move, so from here on I was on my own.}
5. Qd2 b5 6. a3 Bb7 7. O-O-O Nd7 8. f4
{Very aggressive, but in retrospect probably not correct. F3 followed by g4 and h4 was more consistent.}
8... c5 9. Nf3 Ngf6 10. e5 Ng4 $11 11. Bg1 $2
{This drops a pawn, but white was probably overextended anyway. Black appears to be at least equal.}
11... cxd4 12. Bxd4 dxe5 13. fxe5 Bxf3 $6
{After the game my opponent was of the opinion that Black is easily winning after Bh6, but Fritz disagrees.  _It seems to me that his opponent was right.  After 13...Bh6 14.Ng5 Ngxe5 besides the fact that black is up a pawn, the pin is extremely annoying.  If white breaks it with 15.Be3 he also takes the pressure off of black's center and he is more or less just a pawn down for nothing after 15...O-O.  If white plays 15.Kb1 f6 16. Ne6 Bxd2 etc. forces an effective queen exchange.  However we shouldn't be too smug about the fact that white made the wrong move here.  One of the hardest things is when you have the advantage, to choose between several attractive lines and find the one which doesn't allow any counterplay, because first of all you have to see why the other moves do allow counterplay!_}
(13... Ngxe5 14. Qe3 Qc7 $17)
14. gxf3 Ngxe5 15. Qe3 Qc7
{White has certain compensation here due to pressure on e5 and the ideas of Bh3 and Nd5.}
16. Bh3 Nc4 {_?? Andy sort of implies that this is a fatal blunder, but I don't want to leave any doubt!_}
(16... Rd8 {_It seems to me that white also has 17.f4 and 18.Qxe7+ here._} 17. Nd5 Qd6 18. Nb4 O-O 19. Bc3 Qc5 $15)
17. Qxe7+
{White misses a chance with Qe4 here. Instead, I opted to sack my queen. A very odd decision in hindsight. On the other hand, white wins back the pawn this way too.  _The only reason white's move doesn't get two question marks too is that his move is shocking and pretty.  Objectively it is a mistake._}

{_25...Rd2 looks better with the tactical justification 26.b3 Rxh2._}
26. c3 Nc4 27. Bd4 $5
{White has to give up one of the queenside pawns. But which one? Centralizing the bishop appealed during the game, but may not be best.  _To me this is a very weird decision, and 27.b4 keeping a healthier pawn structure looks obvious.  However it is interesting that another decent player (who I can promise you will not be Class B much longer (-; ) valued piece activity more and reasoned along nearly opposite lines.  Apparently there is a lot of room for stylistic differences below, say, the master level._}

{At this point I had learned that one of the B players with 3/5 had won to tie me for the class B prize.
_With the flitting exception of a temporary queen sack, this was a "gritty" game, where black's determination to draw eventually prevailed although white pushed hard.  I would suggest that this is the type of game a player should work on if they are going to improve, because it will tend to bring a lot of the player's weaknesses to the fore: boredom, impatience, lack of consistency, etc.  White did good work annotating this game and if you don't see where I'm coming from it might help to go through the game a second time and try to take away a certain self-critical method that could be applied to your own games._} 1/2-1/2

{In the beginning, we learn simple concepts in chess, like that doubled pawns and isolated pawns are bad. Then, as we develop, we learn so many exceptions to these rules, that we may tend to forget them. The following game is, on the one hand, simple, and on the other hand incredible because white managed to control the game to such a great extent that he won on account of black's pawn weaknesses created in the opening.}

It is true that compared to other lines white's rooks are very good here, and black's bishop is passive.}

1. e4
{The following game is, I think, a very instructive and thematic example of what black is playing for in the King's Gambit with 3...g5. All of black's strategy is based around keeping the "weakling" pawn on f4 alive, because from a dynamic point of view it is incredibly annoying. Therefore, it is also a nice illustration of modern chess.}
1... e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. h4 g4 5. Ne5 d6 $1
{This is not necessarily better than 5...Nf6, but, to the extent that it is the beginning of a thematic plan black implements very nicely in this game, it deserves an exclam. Black has to choose between staying a pawn ahead and keeping the easy to protect g4-pawn, or allowing white to equalize material while the weak f4-pawn continues its precarious existence. He makes the dynamic choice because the f4-pawn is a great nuisance for white, blocking the f-file and the dark-squared bishop.}
6. Nxg4 Nf6 7. Nxf6+ Qxf6 8. Nc3 c6 9. Qf3
{This move carries behind it the devious threat of 10.g4. If white could get that in it would stem black's counterplay on the g-file.}
9... Rg8 10. Qf2 Bg4 11. d3 Bh6 12. Ne2
{White decides he would like to be a pawn ahead, but in doing so he spends precious time and fails to solve the problem of exactly how to develop.  Furthermore, now if the c1-bishop ever moves the b2-pawn will hang.}
(12. Be2 {simply developing the bishop doesn't solve everything:} 12... Nd7 13. Bxg4 Rxg4 {This is good for black.  He has lost the g4-pawn, but in return he has fine play on the g-file.})
(12. Be3 {is a creative approach to the position:} 12... Nd7 13. Bd4 Ne5 14. Be2 O-O-O 15. Bxg4+ Rxg4 {With all of the trouble white has gone to castling on either side remains a bad idea, so his position is not comfortable at all.})
12... Nd7 13. Nxf4 O-O-O 14. g3 Qe5 15. Bg2
(15. Qxa7 {appears too greedy.  However, maybe it was the best way to make black sweat.  The following analysis is not exhaustive but it is interesting food for thought:} 15... Bf3 16. Rg1 f5 17.

15... f5 16. O-O fxe4 17. Bd2 $6
{White approaches the position thus; the b2-pawn is immune because of Qxa7 in conjunction with Rb1, so it's time to finish development by mobilizing his rooks, and to get out of danger.  Apparently it was better to be greedy with 17.Bxe4 or even 17.dxe4.  The main idea would be to stop black's next, but it is hard to imagine white ever exploiting his extra pawn on the kingside since he is under so much pressure there.}

{The Pan-Ams, held December 26-29, couldn't have gone much better in my opinion. My college, UMBC, became co-champions again! They also took the title on tie-breaks this time. I was on their second team which took fourth place in the event, and the highlight of my tournament was the following game which is the first time I have drawn a GM. A somewhat surprising feature is that the game contains many mistakes, despite my opponent's title and high rating.}
1.e4 e6 2.Nf3 !?
{I played this quickly but I had been thinking about whether or not to do it ever since I found out who my opponent was, i.e. about five minutes before the game. The point is that against the Winawer I play a slightly offbeat line, and pretty successfully, but I was afraid that it wouldn't hold up against a GM. This line is less ambitious, but it makes him think about how to make the game interesting.}

(8...O-O {is a blunder.

{I was aware that black can probably equalize immediately now with 9... fe 10.Nxe5 Nxe5 11.Bxe5 Nxe5 12.Qxe5 Qf6. However I was also fairly confident that I would give him a hell of a time trying to beat me in the endgame, where I felt more confident of my abilities than in French-style complications that he is probably very familiar with. So this is a decision based mainly on off-the-board considerations.}

{This cost me a lot of time. I saw the more obvious 13.O-O-O first, but I didn't feel there was enough for the pawn yet. Then it hit me that it might be best to keep the pawn for one more move and let black decide what to do in the mean time. Nonetheless, the move is a mistake because in actual fact I do not get enough for the pawn even after 14.O-O-O.}
(13.O-O {is normal but I preferred the more active plan.})
13...g6 !
{Definitely a creative response. I'm still not sure exactly what black's idea is, but I have a couple of guesses. One is that he wants to play ...Bd6 with tempo since I will not be able to reply Qh5.  There is also an idea that, strangely, he did not try to implement in the game.  In rough form it is to play ...Bxf2, Bc5, Bxf8, Bg7, etc. In any case, it seems to me that this is one of the more relavent things he can do with his time, compared to 13...a6, for example.}

{Wow. it feels like a whole lifetime since I was last updating my site. Since the last game was from the Pan-Ams, I suppose it was actually just a few months. Anyway, I had lost energy for it for a while, and didn't see any point in putting out material unless I had something to say. Recently I have hit a really nasty streak in my chess, losing something like 50 - 75 points over a few tournaments, I think. I'm sure I am stronger than that and I will get them all back, but I still have to try to discover what happened. So I decided to try to annotate some of these losses... the first game I will look at is the most recent one which really sticks out in my mind right now.}
1. Nc3
{This already bodes badly for my mental state. The point is I didn't play 1. e4 because my opponent does really well with the Caro-Kann. However, this just allows him to reach a Caro anyway and only if he wants to! There were better offbeat things for this occasion.}

White actually wants to leave f3 for the knight on g5, and he will typically complete the maneuver Ng5-f3-e5, Ng1-f3. The justification for losing all of these tempi is that black first has to play a bit awkwardly himself to stop Nxf7. In other words, take a look at the following line.} 7... Nb6 8. Bd3 h6 (8...

The other was that, well, at least this was not going to resemble our last game where I was desperately trying to find a way to unbalance things to create winning chances. It is definitely possible that black can overplay or underplay his hand now, and the weak kingside will come back to haunt him.}

{In April, mainly out of boredom playing the same opponents over and over in regular chess, sometimes losing to them, I decided to try "internet correspondence" on itsyourturn.com. At the beginning I had to spend about a month beating some players who probably played about 1200 OTB level, but in the second round things are already getting more interesting, as in the following game.}
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Nxe4 6. d4 b5 7. Bb3 d5 8. dxe5 Be6 9. Nbd2 Nc5 10. c3 d4 11. Ng5 Bd5 12. Nxf7
{It was only here that I looked up the theory and learned that 12.Nxf7 was a move... it seemed more interesting than any of the alternatives so I just played it. I figured that since Svidler had played it once against Anand it couldn't be too bad, so I would just go where the currents took me and figure things out as I went. It turned out that this led to a very interesting struggle.}
12... Kxf7 13. Qf3+ Ke6 14. Ne4
{Before I played this I had got around to studying the position myself and I decided I liked this move better than Svidler's approach. 14.Ne4 is natural; it clears the way for the c1-bishop, the f-pawn, and it has some less obvious points as well.}
(14. Qg4+ Ke7 15. e6 $5 {was the continuation in the extremely interesting game Svidler-Anand, Dos Hermanos, 1999. White intends to keep open the e-file and attack at any cost.} 15... Bxe6 16. Re1)
14... Nxe4 $1 15. Qxe4
{Since the c1-bishop is unleashed black cannot meet 16. Qg4+ anymore with 16...Ke7. Therefore, the main threat is Qg4+, Qf5+, and e5-e6, when there is a mate threat to f7 and the bishop on d5 suddenly hangs. Black's move 15...Ne7 seems like the only way to meet this threat tactically, but since it involves backing up, burying the f8-bishop and leaving the king in the center, I ought to have good compensation for the piece.}
15... Ne7 $1
(15... Be7 16. Qg4+ Kf7 17. Qf5+ Kg8 18. e6)
(15... dxc3 16. Qg4+ Kf7 17. Qf5+ Kg8 (17... Ke8 18. e6 Ne5 19. Qh5+ $1 g6 20. Qxe5 {is also good for white although of course a bit more resiliant than 17...Kg8.}) 18. Qe6+ $3)
16. Bg5 Bxb3 17. Qg4+ $1
{This is an important intermezzo that might not be so easy to spot over the board. I didn't see what would happen but I saw that I had to play it or else I would lose my compensation for the piece, so I was still flowing with the current...}
(17. axb3 Qd5 18. Qg4+ Nf5 $1 {is an important option that black does not have in the game. This is why I played the queen check first.}) 17... Kf7 18. axb3 Qd5 19. c4 {19.f4 immediately might be possible, but it seemed obvious to play this first. The tactical idea is just that if black leaves the diagonal then Qf3+ picks up a rook. c6 is apparently a worse square for the queen because she is actually well-placed in a centralised position; for example f4-f5 is met by just ...Qxe5. However in the game there is another important consideration that comes out; from c6 the queen makes a defense possible with ...Ng6, so 19.c4 may have actually helped black.}
(19. f4 {deserves analysis})
19... bxc4 $1
{Playing this before ...Qc6 avoids cxb5.}
(19... Qc6 20. cxb5 axb5 21. e6+ Ke8 22. Rxa8+ Qxa8 23. Bxe7 (23. Qxd4 Qd5 24. Qa7 Qxe6 25. Qxc7 {is also tempting since black's pieces look idiotic, but I don't see a clear way to win some material back or force mate.}) 23... Bxe7 24. Qxd4 Qc6 25. Qxg7 Rf8 26. Qxh7 Qxe6 27. Qh5+ Kd8 28. Qxb5 {and white is probably a lot better, since a queen trade is no longer an escape for black with three menacing passers.})
20. bxc4 Qc6 21. f4
{Frankly this was the only move I considered since it seemed positionally sound to push the passers ahead. Black has some serious problems to unravel before I play f5-f6 or else he will be losing ... frankly I didn't see how he could do it. If I had appreciated the strength of ...Ng6 then I might have considered grabbing another pawn here with 21.Qxd4.}
21... h6 $1
{Black has a well thought out defense. This move gains a tempo because of my 24th move.}
22. Bh4 h5 23. Qh3 Ng6 $1
{Nice, intending to meet f4-f5 with ...Nxe5. Qf5+ seems like it ought to be disruptive but it doesn't do anything and gets in the way of my pawns.}
24. Bg5 Bc5 $2
{During the game I was more worried about how to get compensation after 24...Be7, and probably justifiably. Although 24...Bc5 seems logical, it is probably a mistake if black cannot find any improvements on the game and 38.Rf5 is as strong as it appears.}

{It was only in this position that I finally found some tactical ways to get back the material... I was ecstatic, surely this must mean I am winning? If I can get back material, and retain my attack?! 30.Qd3 is not the most obviously agressive move but it threatens f5-f6 and Qg6, and stops defenses based on d4-d3+.}
