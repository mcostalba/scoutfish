10.cxd4 Bg4 11.Be3 Na5 12.Bc2 Nc4 13.Bc1 
{is this a loss of time? Not really, since the knight will eventually be forced back with b2-b3 and then the bishop can be profitably employed at b2.} 
c5 
{Classical Spanish play. Black will expand on the queenside and White will attempt to keep control of the center and attack on the kingside.} 
14.b3 Na5 15.Bb2 
{As promised. It would have been wrong to push the d-pawn, because then Black would simply swing his knight from f6 to d7 and stick the bishop on the long diagonal.} 
Nc6 16.d5 Nb4 
{Black has lured White into playing d4-d5, but it has cost him some time. He now attempts to eliminate the Spanish bishop, which can be dangerous after e5.} 
17.Nbd2 Nxc2 18.Qxc2 
{Black now has the bishop pair, but White controls the center and has a strong bishop at b2. Should he play on the kingside, as usual, or perhaps undermine the Black pawn structure with a2-a4. Or both? And how to time all ofthis?} 
Re8 19.Qd3 
{A very nice move which increases the pressure on the queenside while making it easier for the queen to get to the kingside via the third rank. Before making a concrete plan, White strives to improve the position of his pieces.} 
h6 $18 
{If Black was worried about e4-e5, he could have played Nf6-d7, but White isn't ready for such action yet. 19...Nd7 20.e5 Bxf3 21.Nxf3 dxe5 22.Nxe5 Nxe5 23.Bxe5 Bd6 24.Bxd6 Qxd6 25.Rad1 is not likely to be enough to win, given the block$} 
20.Nf1 Nd7 21.h3 Bh5 
{Black is a little too attached to his bishop pair. He should have captured and then played Bf6, to take control of the e5 square which has been the center of attention for some time.} 
22.N3d2 Bf6 23.Bxf6 Qxf6 
{Black seems to have secured the central squares, but now White deflects the Black knight to the queenside, and then launches his attack.} 
24.a4 c4 25.bxc4 Nc5 26.Qe3 bxa4 
{The position has changed considerably. Black has some valuable assets on the queenside and a seemingly well-placed knight, but it is actually offside.} 
27.f4 
{White is prepared to bring a pawnstorm against the enemy king. The Nc5 cannot come to the aid of its monarch. The attack can be repelled, but only by going into a complicated endgame.} 
Qe7 28.g4 Bg6 29.f5 Bh7 30.Ng3 Qe5 31.Kg2 Rab8 32.Rab1 f6 
{This is a passive move which creates further holes in Black's position. Since all of his chances lay on the queenside, he should have continued with his infiltration of the White position. 32...Rb2 33.Rxb2 Qxb2 would have been appropriate.} 
33.Nf3 Rb2+ 34.Rxb2 Qxb2+ 35.Re2 
{This is a much more comfortable position for White. The hole at e6 will be a nice landing site for the Nf3, and the passed pawn is not important.} 
Qb3 36.Nd4 Qxe3 37.Rxe3 Rb8 
{At first sight it seems that Black has all the chances with his open file and passed pawn. But White sees the potential of a passed d- pawn!} 
38.Rc3 Kf7 39.Kf3 Rb2 40.Nge2 Bg8 
{Now White, keeping in mind the theme of the previous variations, sees that he can achieve his goal of a passed d-pawn. He notices that the pawn at e4 is not a material consideration in this position.} 
41.Ne6 Nb3 
{Of course Black cannot even think about exchanging at e6 and entombing the bishop. 41...Nxe4 42.Kxe4 Rxe2+ 43.Kd4 is a winning endgame for White, since the bishop is absolutely useless and the king is closeenough} 
42.c5 dxc5 43.Nxc5 Nd2+ 44.Kf2 Ke7 
{Again Black finds himself unthinkingly following conventional wisdom by moving his king to the center. But he needed to invest more thought in his queenside advantage. 44...Nb1! was best.} 
45.Ke1 Nb1 46.Rd3 a3 
{and here Black should have stuck to his plan, instead of belatedly switching to the queenside advance. 46...Kd6! gives drawing chances.} 
47.d6+ Kd8 
{At this point White is concentrating on mate rather than a longwinded endgame. The idea is that a knight at c6 would force the king off the queening square.}

b6 22.Ref1 Qg6 23.f5 Qf6 24.e4 
{Given the fact that White's pieces enjoy superior mobility, it is possible for him to preserve chances on both sides of the board by locking the center. The threat of a kingside pawn storm will trouble Black for some time.}

Unlike most World Championship matches, which start out like boxing matches with a cautious first round, this is an early slugfest. 7...Ne7 8.Qxg7 Rg8 9.Qxh7 cxd4 10.Kd1 This is a popular line, similar to the game, which is known as the "Life or Death Variation".} 
8.Qg3 Ne7 9.Qxg7 Rg8 10.Qxh7 
{The difference between this and the line in the previous note is that here the queen cannot easily retreat to help defend the king.} 
cxd4 11.Kd1 
{This is not such a good idea here, because the queen is in exile at h7. Tal, in his notes to the game, indicates that this eccentric move has pretty much vanished from the tournament arena. The move was originally recommended by Euwe.}

{This forces White to weaken the a4-d1 diagonal.} 
14.cxd3 Ba4+ 15.Ke1 Qxe5 
{An obvious move but it is actually a bit slow. In order to attack successfully Black needs more power, and so developing the Nb8 would have been better. 15...Nc6 16.f4 O-O-O 17.Bd2 Tal notes that sooner or later Black will sacrifice the knight at e5, with complications which are hard.}

20.dxe5 Ncxe5 21.Re3

{Spassky launches an all-out attack. Black has to accept the proffered pawn or else it will be shoved down his throat!}

1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f4 
{The Four Pawn's Attack, once thought to be the refutation of the King's Indian Defense. A sharp and little investigated position arises which promises a tense struggle.} 
O-O 6.Nf3 c5 7.d5 e6 
{Vaiser stated after the game that this variation had served him well for the past 14 years.} 
8.Be2 exd5 
{Three years previous to this game Vaiser and I had played a blitz match. Every time I played Black we reached this position and Vaiser continued with 9.cxd5. However, I was in for an unpleasant surprise.} 
9.e5 
{The exclamation mark is based on psychological considerations. My opponent knew that of the three principal continuations, 9. exd5, 9.cxd5, and 9.e5, the third would come as the greatest surprise. Now I was improvising.} 
Ng4 10.cxd5 dxe5 11.h3 e4 12.hxg4 
{Before this game was played theory had ignored this move with 12.Nxe4 being preferred.} 
exf3 13.gxf3 
{Black's chief problem is his lack of useful squares for the development of his pieces on the queenside. Perhaps my experience at the board influences my pessimistic evaluation, today I would prefer to play White's position.} 
Re8 
{If I tried to prevent the advance f4-f5 by 13...f5, then the a2-g8 diagonal would be weakened, and that could prove the road to Black's destruction in the near future.} 
14.f5 
{Played with the idea of developing the dark squared bishop to h6 where it will disturb the only defender of the Black king, which is also Black's only active piece.}

15.Bh6 
{White pays no attention to the "mosquito bites" of his opponent and carries on with his general plan.} 
Qxb2 
{I recognized the danger facing the Black position, but decided to be consistent and took the pawn. Perhaps it will turn out all right...} 
16.Bxg7 Kxg7 
{The abundance of White's attacking possibilities is noticeable at first glance , but I comforted myself with the thought that not just any move would win.} 
17.f6+ 
{Well here the pace picked up...White couldn't hold himself back from storming the walls of the king's fortress and sends in a single column of attack. 17.Rc1 During the game it seemed to me that this move was not sufficiently forcing. Detailed analysis, however, later showed that I was wrong.} 
Kg8 
{In this position I began to glance at the White king which has remained in the center.} 
18.Qc1 
{Vaiser proposes an endgame, where his opponent's lag in development and the strong pawn on f6 would be factors operating in White's favor. But has he got a surprise coming!} 
Qb4 
{This move seems suicidal, since the entrance of the White queen to h6 creates two deadly threats. However, I was well prepared for this.} 
19.Kf1 
{White should have regrouped and, putting aside his ambitious thoughts, come to terms with the leveling of chances. 19.Qd2 should be preferred. 19.Qd2 Nd7 20.Rb1 Qd4 21.Qxd4 cxd4 22.Ne4 d3 23.Bxd3 Nxf6 24.Kf2 Nxd5 25.Rb5 is good for White due to the weak f6 square.} 
Nd7 20.Bb5 
{This move looks pretty convincing-there seems no way to keep the White queen from reaching the coveted h6 square. 20.Qh6 Nxf6 when Black's king is safe.} 
Qd4 21.Kg2 
{21.Qh6 Nxf6 22.Bxe8 Qxc3 23.Kg2 Bxg4 24.Bxf7+ Kxf7 25.fxg4 Re8 when White's can do nothing against the united strength ofBlack's} 
Re3 
{This move is much stronger than the "greedy" 21...Qxf6, which would give White considerable counterplay. 21...Qxf6 22.Qh6 Qg7 23.Ne4 when Black has problems developing his queenside due to the pinned knight.} 
22.Ne2 Qe5 23.Kf2 Rxe2+ 24.Bxe2 Nxf6 
{Now one can sum up the results of White's "blitzkrieg". His attack has been exhausted, and the extra exchange hardly carries any importance. Black has two pawns for it, and the open position of White's king allow favorable tactics.} 
25.Qxc5 
{In avoiding the worst, White heads for an endgame, but Black manages to win another pawn, after his advantage is beyond doubt. It should be noted that we were both in time trouble at this point.} 
Bxg4 26.Qe3 
{26.fxg4 allows Black to win White's queen.} 
Qxe3+ 27.Kxe3 Nxd5+ 28.Kf2 Be6 29.Rab1 
{This position is superior for Black, as he has three pawns for the exchange.} 
b6 30.Rbc1 Nf4 31.a3 Nxe2 32.Kxe2 b5 33.Rc7 a5 34.Rb1 Bc4+ 35.Kf2 a4 
{Such an antipositional pawn structure is justified, since supported by the pawn the bishop is no less strong than the rook.} 
36.Re1 Rd8 37.Re3 Rd2+ 38.Kg3 Kg7 39.f4 Rb2 40.Rc5 h5 
{Here the game was adjourned, but White, having sealed 41.Kh4, resigned before resumption. One could argue with this, but Black does have a clear path to victory. For example (see variation). 40...h5 41.Kh4 Rb3 42.Rg3 Rb1 43.Re3 Rg1 44.Rg5 Rh1+ 45.Kg3 f5 cutting off the rook from the queenside.}

{See, I couldn't have done this if his knight were at b3 because then after 13.Rd1 Be6 his c-pawn would be defended by the bishop at c1.} 
13.Nd5 
{Here I thought for over an hour, a personal record at the time. Usually when I think for a long time, I tend to play the most aggressive line. Here it involves a sacrifice. 13.Rd1 Be6 14.Nc1 Rc8 15.Qxd6 Nd4 16.Qxd8 Rexd8 17.b3 b5 Black has an initiative on the queenside.} 
b5 14.Bb6 Qd7 15.Nc7 Rb8 16.Nxe8 Qxe8

17.Be3 
{Black may b e the exchange down, but I have an initiative due to the lack of development in White's camp. 17.cxb5 Rxb6 18.bxc6 d5 The game is opening up and I have pressure on the center, while White's king is stuck in the center.}

{At this point White must determine his strategy for the remainder of the game. His goal is to infiltrate the kingside, and exploit the weak light squares. 26...Ne4 27.Bxe4 fxe4 28.Nxe4 is clearly better for White, with a SuperKnight at e4 and threats along the g-file.}

h6 11.Be3 Re8 
{In order to achieve an advantage White will eventually capture an enemy bishop on e6, weakening Black's kingside and gaining the bishop pair. On the other hand it will be difficult to fight against Black's pawn center.}

1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.Nf3 
{Until now I had mostly played 4.e3, the most common move. But I wanted to surprise Karpov in this initial game of our match.} 
c5 5.g3 
{This system, often used by Oleg Romanishin, really caught Karpov off-guard, and he thought for a long time before responding. This may explain why he quickly deviated from the best-known variations.} 
Ne4 6.Qd3 Qa5 
{Capturing at d4 is normal.} 
7.Qxe4 Bxc3+ 8.Bd2 Bxd2+ 9.Nxd2 Qb6 
{A mistake. For a few years this position had been bouncing around, and I had prepared it well. But even after 9...Nc6 White stands well.} 
10.dxc5 Qxb2 11.Rb1 Qc3 12.Qd3 
{This forces an endgame which is clearly better for White. If the queen retreats then after 13.Bg2 Black is paralyzed.} 
Qxd3 13.exd3 Na6 
{13...Nc6 14.Bg2 b6 15.Ne4 Ke7 16.Kd2 f5 17.cxb6 axb6 18.Nc3 Black has too many weaknesses to hold out for long.} 
14.d4 Rb8 
{Better was 14...e5, but I still would have had a superior position. Karpov rarely parts with pawns unless it is absolutely necessary.} 
15.Bg2 Ke7 16.Ke2 
{I slipped up here. Usually in the endgame the king belongs in the center, but there are a few tactics lying around which should have led me to simply castle onto the kingside.} 
Rd8 17.Ne4 b6 18.Nd6 Nc7 
{Karpov's idea -- exchanging for the knight at d6 via Ne8 -- is a good one, but there was an even stronger move available. 18...bxc5 19.Nxc8+ Rdxc8 20.Bb7 Rxb7 The point! 21.Rxb7 cxd4 22.Rxa7 Nc5 Black has a strong position in the center and a well-posted knight, which provide a lot of compensation for the exchange.} 
19.Rb4 
{I am preparing to double rooks on the b-file.} 
Ne8 20.Nxe8 
{Not best. I should have taken the bishop instead. Perhaps I was influenced by the fact that it hadn't made a single move yet!} 
Kxe8 
{Karpov returns the favor by capturing with the wrong piece! His forces all lie powerless on the back rank -- a pretty pathetic sight that could only appeal to a player like Petrosian.} 
21.Rhb1 Ba6 22.Ke3 d5 23.cxd6 
{An example of an en passant capture.} 
Rbc8 24.Kd3 
{In this first game I was not a full strength and missed the simple and effective winning line. 24. Ra4 Bxc4 25.Bb7 b5 26.d7+ Kxd7 27.Bxc8+ Kxc8 28.Rxa7}

{Breaking the pin on the b-file, but now Black can regroup.}

{We have reached a double-rook endgame where I have an extra pawn, but it is a rather weak one. Still, with proper technique such positions are easy to win .}

{The game has developed along Classical lines. Even though Karpov chooses the Nimzoindian Defense, he isn't really a Hypermodern player at heart. So it is somewhat strange that he prematurely concedes the center with this move.} 
10.Bxc4 Nc6 11.O-O Be7 
{Actually, I have an extra tempo by comparison with most Queen's Gambit positions. We have left the world of the Nimzoindian for good, and the excursion of the bishop from f8 to b4 and back to e7 is just a waste of time.} 
12.Re1 b6 13.a3 Bb7 14.Bg3 Rc8 15.Ba2 Bd6 
{A good move. Karpov eases the pressure on his position by preparing to trade bishops. He also creates a nice square at e7 for the knight. I over- reacted.}

{The real point of this move is to transfer the queen to the kingside. But it also sets a trap.} 
Rfd8 21.Rcd1 
{I am dangling the b-pawn as bait. Karpov is much too good a player to fall for the trap, but perhaps the distraction caused him to create a situation on the h3-c8 diagonal he would quickly come to regret.} 
Rd7 
{Correct was 21...Rc7.}

1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 d6 4.Nc3 g6 5.e4 Bg7 
{Fischer plays a Benoni-style King's Indian. After a brief spell in a transpositional Twilight Zone, the game returns to well-known channels.} 
6.Bd3 
{This is a more reliable move than 6.Bg5.} 
O-O 7.Nf3 
{Spassky plays conservatively, confident that Black's formation is not a solid one. The point is that by delaying e7-e6, Black will allow his opponent to recapture at d5 with the e-pawn, and the pawn structure will be good for White} 
Bg4 
{This is a well-known maneuver to fight for the e5 square, but we think that Black could have occupied that key square immediately with a good game. 7...e5 8.O-O Ne8 and f7-f5 will give Black an excellent position.} 
8.h3 Bxf3 9.Qxf3 
{The exchange of bishop for knight is a common theme in this variation. The bishop has little future in this pawn formation, and the two knights can be used effectively. Fischer has shown a preference for knights in this match.} 
Nbd7 10.Qd1 
{White avoids Ne5, which would have forked the bishop and queen, leading to the elimination of the powerful bishop.}

13.Bd2 Ne5 14.Be2 f5 
{Fischer employed an analogous idea in his game against Korchnoi from the Sousse Interzonal, 1967. The idea is to take control of e4 and stop f2-f4- f5.} 
15.f4 Nf7 
{The e6-square looks weak, but it is not easy to take advantage of this. Still, the knight should have gone to d7, from which it could retreat to f8 later if needed, or work on the queenside via b6.} 
16.g4 
{White's goal is to increase the activity of his bishop pair and take control of all the important dark squares, in particular e5 and f6.} 
Nh6 
{It is not easy to give a recommendation for Black here, but inviting g4- g5 was hardly the correct plan. There are two alternatives which come to mind, each of which may help justify Fischer's play in the opening. 16...fxg4 17. hxg4 g5!? undermines White's pressure at e5.} 
17.Kg2

Nc7 18.g5 Nf7 19.Rb1 Re8 20.Bd3 Rb8 21.h4 a6 22.Qc2 b5 23.b3 
{White's general plan is to advance his h-pawn, while Black's potential queenside counterplay has been neutralized by this move. Fischer is a player who requires active piece play, and here he is suffocating.} 
Rb7 
{Fischer's play on the b-file will be futile. Spassky now increases the pressure slowly and surely.} 
24.Rbe1 Rxe1 25.Rxe1 Qb8 
{The threat is to capture on c4 and infiltrate on b2, but Spassky deprives Fischer of any such play with his next move.}

{The knight is being transfered to an attacking post at g3.} 
bxc4 28.bxc4 Ne8 29.h5 Re7 30.h6

Bh8 31.Bd2 Rb7 32.Rb1 Qb8 33.Ng3 Rxb1 34.Qxb1 Qxb1 35.Bxb1 
{The elimination of the heavy pieces favors White, since Black's remaining forces have no scope.} 
Bb2 36.Kf3 Kf8 
{White has achieved a winning position. Now perhaps the most efficient path to victory is the one which both Deep Thought and our analytical team prefer, namely the immediate sacrifice at f5.} 
37.Ke2 
{37.Nxf5 gxf5 38.Bxf5 Kg8 39.Bc8 and the a-pawn falls. Spassky chooses another path, and it is also convincing.} 
Nh8 
{An ugly move, but otherwise disaster could strike quickly. 37...Ke7 38.Nxf5+ gxf5 39.Bxf5 and the h-pawn falls.} 
38.Kd1 Ke7 39.Kc2 Bd4 40.Kb3 Bf2 41.Nh1

1.e4 c5 
{After the disaster of the previous Spanish Inquisition, Spassky slides into Sicilian territory.} 
2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 
{Somewhat of a surprise. Fischer usually prefers the well-traveled paths of more topical lines, enjoying the theoretical duels.} 
g6 4.Bxc6 bxc6 
{Theory prefers 4...dxc6, but there is nothing wrong with this choice.} 
5.O-O Bg7 6.Re1 e5 
{A critical advance, which prevents White from playing e4-e5 or d2-d4. But the blocking of the long diagonal creates an interesting opportunity for White. Spassky consistently rejects previous praxis, but opts for 6...f6 in game 13.} 
7.b4 
{A typical example of a move which is trivial when played prematurely (at move 2) but which can be quite effective if delayed until an appropriate moment.} 
cxb4 8.a3 
{This gambit underlines the defects of 6...e5.} 
c5 
{8...d6 9.axb4 Ne7 10. h3 O-O 11.d3 gives White a slightly better position, because there are some weaknesses in Black's position. But 8...bxa3 9.Bxa3 d6 gives White sufficient compensation for the pawn, but how much more?} 
9.axb4 cxb4 10.d4

exd4 
{10...d6?! 11.dxe5 dxe5 12.Qxd8+ Kxd8 13.Bd2! regains the pawn with interest.} 
11.Bb2 d6 
{Now the long diagonal can be the site of some tactical operations.} 
12.Nxd4

{12...Qb6 13.Nd2 Bxd4 14.Nc4 Bxf2+ 15.Kh1 Qc5 16.Nxd6+ Ke7 17.Nf5+! wins for White.}

1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f3 O-O 6.Be3 Nc6 7.Nge2 a6 8.h4 
{A very unusual move in this position, but it can lead to more normal lines if White chooses to transpose.} 
h5 9.Nc1 
{This is the real new idea. It is perhaps not an appropriate move in this position, though the real test does not come in the present game. 9.Qd2 Rb8 is also possible.} 
e5 
{9...Rb8!? 1 0.Nb3 Bd7 is more consistent with Black's strategy, aiming for an early break with b5.} 
10.d5 Ne7 
{10...Nd4 is probably stronger.} 
11.Be2 Nh7 
{Black prepares to launch kingside counterplay with f7-f5, after which the pawn at h4 can become very weak. His knights suffer from the lack of entry squares on the kingside, a situation brought about by 8...h5.} 
12.Nd3 
{White now contr ols f4 as well as g5, so there really is no possibility of kingside counterplay for Black.} 
f5 13.a4 
{White prevents Black from playing a freeing b7-b5. This shuts down any queenside action on Black's part.} 
Nf6 14.Nf2 
{This is the logical continuation of White's strategy, limiting Black's counterplay at each turn and taking control of more squares, in this case g4 and e4.} 
a5 
{A simply horrible move. it prevents a4-a5, but eliminates any chance of getting in b7-b5.} 
15.Qc2 c5 
{Another error, but a consistent follow-up to the previous mistake. Fischer must have underestimated White's potential energy on the kingside. 15...f4 16.Bd2 Bh6 17. g3 fxg3 18.Bxh6 gxf2+ was a better plan.} 
16.O-O-O b6 17.Rdg1 Nh7 18.Nb5 Kh8 
{Pointless, since the knight at e7 cannot be brought to h6 because White will plant a pawn at g5. 18...f4 might still be best, for example 19.Bd2 Rf7 20.g4 fxg3 21.Rxg3 Nf8 22.Nh3 Bxh3 23.Rgxh3}

{Much too late.} 
21.Bd2 
{It is now clear that Black has no counterplay, and his king is in danger on the h-file.} 
g5

29.Nf3 Rbf7 30.Rh6 
{Desperation, but well justified.}

{Strong and simple. There is no way to save the knight.}

1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nd2 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nd7 5.Ng5 
{This has become all the rage in the past couple of years, despite the fact that it was considered harmless for decades! I am just fooling around, really. I intend to transpose back to the main lines soon enough.} 
Ngf6 6.Bc4 e6 7.Qe2 
{Now we are back in the familiar territory of opening theory.} 
Nb6 8.Bb3 
{This retreat offers more chances for complications than moving to d3, so it is just my kind of move.} 
h6 9.N5f3 c5 
{9...a5 is a promising alternative, but it does weaken the queenside and gives up any thoughts of castling queenside.} 
10.Bf4 Bd6 
{Unusual. More typical is 11...a6, which prepares a future b5. But this is very much in keeping with Karpov's style. He likes to simplify the position by exchanging pieces.} 
11.Bg3 Qe7 
{Black can also try 11...Qc7 or 11...O-O. But to exchange bishops at g3 would be pointless, from a strategic point of view, because I could use the h- file to great advantage.} 
12.dxc5 Bxc5 13.Ne5 Bd7 
{13...Nbd7 14.Ngf3 Nxe5 15.Nxe5 I would be satisfied with such a position as White.} 
14.Ngf3 
{14.O-O-O This would have laid a trap, but Karpov would no doubt have avoided it: 14...O-O-O?? 15.Nxf7 Qxf7 16.Qe5 Winning.} 
Nh5 15.O-O-O Nxg3 
{Now I get an open h-file but otherwise the bishop could have become a useful weapon. 15...O-O-O 16.Nxd7 Nxd7 17.Be5 Now Black would get in trouble if he captured at e5: 17...Nxe5 18.Nxe5 Nf4 19.Qc4} 
16.hxg3 O-O-O 
{This is a c ritical position. Black can claim equality against normal moves like Nxd7 or Rd3, but I came up with a very effective plan. Not only the spectators, but even my opponent had to re-evaluate the position.} 
17.Rh5 
{Karpov started to get visibly worried here. The threat is simply Nxf7, with a discovered attack on the bishop at c5. The pressure on the 5th rank is immense. The Gordian Knot can only be cut at very great cost.} 
Be8 
{17...g6 This was probably the best defense, even though it entails a serious weakening of the kingside pawn structure.} 
18.Rxd8+ Kxd8 19.Qd2+ Bd6 
{19...Kc8 20.Qc3 f5 21.Bxe6+ If Black takes the bishop, then I capture at c5. So the position is very good for me here.} 
20.Nd3 Qc7 21.g4 
{The advance of the g-pawn is part of my new strategy. Here Karpov plays rather passively.} 
Kc8 22.g5 Bf8 23.Rh4 Kb8 24.a4 Be7 
{This is a serious mistake which costs Karpov a critical tempo. 24...Nc8 25.g6 fxg6 26.Nd4 Black is under considerable pressure, but the game may not be lost yet.} 
25.a5 Nd5 26.Kb1 
{The point of this move is to get off of the c-file, so that I can advance the c-pawn.} 
Bd8 
{26...Rf8 27.Bxd5 exd5 28.Nb4 Bc6 29.gxh6 Bxh4 Now I have a very pretty combination to wrap things up: 30.Na6+ bxa6 31.Qb4+ Ka8 32.Qxf8+ Kb7 33.h7 The pawn reaches the promotion square.} 
27.a6 Qa5 28.Qe2

30.Nxg5 Qxg5 31.Rh5

{The fatal err or. The knight retreat was called for. 40...Nf8! 41.Qd4+ Ke6 42.Nf5 Bf6! 43. Qxf4 Be5 and Black could still put up a fight.} 
41.Qd4+ Ke6 42.Nf5 
{There is the threat of a big fork at g7.} 
Bf8 
{42...gxf5 43.Bxf5++} 
43.Qxf4 Kd7 44.Nd4 
{The b5-pawn is unprotected. Spassky makes one more attempt at counterplay.} 
Qe1+ 45.Kg2 Bd5+ 46.Be4 Bxe4+ 47.Nxe4 Be7 48.Nxb5 Nf8 49.Nbxd6 Ne6 
{Spassky resigned here, rather than face...}
